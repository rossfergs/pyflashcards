"Question","Answer"
"What are the 3 V's of Big Data as defined by the IDC in 2011?","Volume, Variety, Velocity."
"Give three examples of datasets with high velocity.","Financial market data, social media feeds, and IoT sensor streams."
"Why is raw and detailed information preferred for storage in Big Data?","Raw data preserves maximum detail, allowing for flexible analysis and minimizing information loss."
"How does data in Big Data differ from relational databases?","Big Data often includes unstructured or semi-structured data, whereas relational databases handle structured data organized in rows and columns."
What are the differences between the data stored in relational databases and the data dealt with in big data analysis?,"Relational databases store structured, schema-defined data, while big data analysis often deals with semi-structured or unstructured data in large, diverse, and fast-moving volumes."
Explain how fault tolerance is implemented in Spark and Storm.,"Spark uses lineage for RDD recovery, while Storm uses acknowledgments and task replay mechanisms for reliable processing."
"Define the concepts of data streams, bolts, and spouts in Storm and explain how they are used to build Storm topologies.","Data streams are flows of data, spouts are sources of streams, and bolts process or transform the streams. Together, they build directed acyclic graph-based topologies."
What are the main advantages of Apache Spark over Apache Hadoop?,"Spark provides in-memory computing, better performance, and support for diverse workloads like streaming and machine learning."
What is the difference between stateful and stateless service in distributed file systems?,"Stateful services maintain client session information, while stateless services do not retain session data between requests."
"Name three desired properties of a Big Data system.","Scalability, Fault Tolerance, Low Latency."
"Why are properties like scalability, fault tolerance, and low latency desirable in Big Data systems?","Scalability handles growing data sizes; fault tolerance ensures data integrity during failures; low latency supports real-time operations."
"What are the three layers of Lambda Architecture?","Batch Layer, Serving Layer, Speed Layer."
What are the differences between the data stored in relational databases and the data dealt with in big data analysis?,"Relational databases store structured, schema-defined data, while big data analysis often deals with semi-structured or unstructured data in large, diverse, and fast-moving volumes."
What does the CAP theorem state?,"The CAP theorem states that a distributed system can only guarantee two of the following three properties: Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance."
"What is the purpose of the Batch Layer in Lambda Architecture?","Stores the master dataset and precomputes batch views for querying."
"What is the role of Namenodes and Datanodes in HDFS?","Namenodes manage metadata and file system operations, while Datanodes handle the actual storage and replication of data blocks."
"Describe the process of reading a file from HDFS.","Client contacts Namenode for metadata and block locations, then retrieves the data directly from the appropriate Datanodes."
"What is the difference between stateful and stateless services in distributed file systems?","Stateful services maintain session state across requests, while stateless services handle each request independently."
"What benefits does Cloud Computing provide for Big Data analytics?","Scalability, cost efficiency, on-demand resource availability, and reduced maintenance overhead."
"What does the CAP theorem state?","It is impossible for a distributed database to simultaneously provide Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance."
"Name types of databases commonly used in the NoSQL movement.","Key-Value Stores, Document Stores, Column-Family Stores, Graph Databases."
"What applications is Hadoop not suitable for?","Low-latency applications like real-time gaming or interactive systems."
"How does Hadoop enable parallelism in the Reduce phase?","By dividing output data into partitions and processing them with multiple reducers."
"What is the role of a Partitioner in Hadoop MapReduce?","Determines how intermediate key-value pairs are distributed among reducers."
"What is pattern matching in Scala used for?","It simplifies handling of data structures by matching on their shape or value."
"How do Scala functions differ from Java or C++ functions?","Scala functions are first-class citizens and support concise syntax, closures, and higher-order functions."
"What are the main advantages of the Scala concurrency model?","Actor-based concurrency avoids shared state and uses message passing for thread-safe interactions."
"What are the advantages of Apache Spark over Apache Hadoop?","In-memory computation, faster execution, and better support for iterative algorithms."
"Differentiate between transformations and actions in Spark.","Transformations define operations on RDDs, producing new RDDs lazily, while actions trigger computation and return results."
"What are data streams, bolts, and spouts in Storm?","Data streams are unbounded sequences of tuples, spouts produce streams, and bolts process them to form topologies."
"How is fault tolerance implemented in Spark?","Through lineage graphs that rebuild lost data partitions."
"How is fault tolerance implemented in Storm?","By replaying tuples from failed nodes using an acknowledgment mechanism."
"How would you implement a MapReduce-like system using actors in Scala?","Actors can coordinate tasks like mapping and reducing by exchanging messages and handling data partitioning and aggregation."
"What are the two main types of operations in Spark?","Transformations and Actions."
"Define a Global Secondary Index in DynamoDB.","An index with a partition and sort key different from the table's primary key, enabling additional query flexibility."
"How does Hadoop HDFS ensure data availability?","By replicating data blocks across multiple nodes in the cluster."
"Explain the role of fault tolerance in distributed systems.","Ensures system functionality and data availability despite hardware or software failures."
"What is a Data Mart?","A smaller, subject-specific subset of a data warehouse tailored for departmental use."
"Describe the purpose of the Serving Layer in Lambda Architecture.","Provides precomputed batch views for fast querying."
"How does Spark optimize iterative algorithms?","By using in-memory computation to avoid repeated disk I/O."
"What is an example of a commutative and associative operation suitable for parallelism?","Summation, as it can be performed in any order."
"What is the role of metadata in HDFS?","Metadata, managed by Namenodes, tracks file locations, replication details, and the file system structure."
"Why is differential privacy important in Big Data?","It ensures individual data privacy by adding noise to the results of analyses."
"Name two transformations in Apache Spark.","`map` and `filter`."
"Name two actions in Apache Spark.","`count` and `collect`."
"What is the ETL process in data warehousing?","Extract, Transform, Load; it prepares data for analysis by integrating, cleaning, and transforming it."
